## Overview
### Description
Language barriers are a very common issue when it comes to traveling to getting to know someone who doesnâ€™t speak the same language as you. Breaking Barriers is designed to act as a real time conversation translator. Two people would have a normal conversation and speak into a phone one at a time. As one person speaks into it, whatever they said would be translated and outputted in the others persons desired language while also displaying the text on screen. Then from there, they can just talk back in forth as any other person would do in a normal conversation.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Lifestyle
- **Mobile:** Section for natural conversation, section for scanning documents/text and a section for day to day translation of words.
- **Story:** Use a natural language processing API. Would be used to eliminate language barriers. One person would speak then that would get translated in the other language then vice-versa. Would try and make for a seamless conversation
- **Market:** This could be for anybody that wants to be able to break language barriers. Could also be used to learn as you can see what is being translated.
- **Habit:** This has the potential to be habit forming. If they are in a situation where they need an on the go conversion translator this can be it.
- **Scope:** Integrate Google language processing API as well with any other natural language processing API.
